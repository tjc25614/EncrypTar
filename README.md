# EncrypTar
A Python script for password-protected tarballs

## Technical Description
EncrypTar uses AES in Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) to encrypt compressed tarballs
generated by Python's tarfile module. Using AES in this mode provides both
confidentiality and integrity to the data. The key for encryption is derived from
a user-specified password using PKCS#5 PBKDF2.

The file format EncrypTar uses is as simple as possible. The diagram below shows
the layout of EncrypTar files.

```
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Magic Bytes | Key salt | Nonce    | Tag      | Encrypted Tarball          |
| 0x25 0x24   |          |          |          |                            |
| 2 bytes     | 16 bytes | 16 bytes | 16 bytes | Variable length            |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

* Magic Bytes - Two bytes to identify EncrypTar files
* Key salt - A random value to produce more random looking keys from passwords
* Nonce - Used as an IV in AES-GCM to produce unique key-streams
* Tag - Allows password-checking and integrity-checking
* Encrypted Tarball - The ciphertext of the tarball of the user's files

There is a constant total of 50 bytes of overhead on the regular size of a
tarball in this system.
